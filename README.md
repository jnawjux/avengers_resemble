# Avengers, resemble!

This is a basic implimentation of facial recognition using the Python package [facial_recognition](https://github.com/jnawjux/avengers_resemble) to find which Avenger character you look most like.

### Basic implimentation:

Simply run with route to the image file you would like to try (preferably jpg):

```
python resemble.py <filename>
```

If you would like to add more images, or use different images entirely, you can update the `avengers/` folder with the files and run:

```
python assemble.py
```

Which will create an updated pickle file with all the image facial encodings.
